        "content": "Pinyin is the Romanization system for Standard Chinese. It uses the Latin alphabet to represent the sounds of Mandarin. The most critical aspect is the 'tones'. There are four main tones and one neutral tone: 1st Tone (high and level, e.g., mā 妈 - mother), 2nd Tone (rising, e.g., má 麻 - hemp), 3rd Tone (falling-rising, e.g., mǎ 马 - horse), and 4th Tone (falling, e.g., mà 骂 - scold). The same syllable with different tones has completely different meanings.",

        "content": "Chinese characters are logograms, where each character represents a syllable and a meaning, not just a sound. They are the oldest continuously used system of writing in the world. Characters are built from components, the most basic of which are 'radicals' (部首 bùshǒu), which often give a clue to the character's meaning. Learning characters involves recognizing the structure (e.g., left-right, top-bottom) and practicing stroke order.",
