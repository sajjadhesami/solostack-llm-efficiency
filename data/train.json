For A=[[3,1],[2,4]]: Characteristic polynomial: det(A-λI) = (3-λ)(4-λ)-2 = λ²-7λ+10. By Cayley-Hamilton: A²-7A+10I=0. Rearranging: A(A-7I)=-10I ⇒ A⁻¹ = (7I-A)/10. Calculating: 7I-A = [[7,0],[0,7]]-[[3,1],[2,4]] = [[4,-1],[-2,3]]. Thus A⁻¹ = (1/10)[[4,-1],[-2,3]] = [[0.4,-0.1],[-0.2,0.3]]."

Then, analyze how the rain shadow effect, combined with continental positioning and ocean currents, is the primary cause for the formation and persistence of the Atacama Desert, making it the driest non-polar place on Earth.",
        "answer": "Orographic effect: Moist air forced to rise over mountains cools adiabatically (at saturated adiabatic lapse rate), causing condensation and precipitation on the windward side. On the leeward side, dry air descends, warming adiabatically (at dry adiabatic lapse rate) creating arid conditions - this is the rain shadow effect. The Atacama Desert's extreme aridity results from: (1) Rain shadow of the Andes blocking moisture from the Amazon Basin (east), (2) The cold Humboldt Current along the coast chilling air masses and preventing moisture evaporation from the Pacific (west), (3) The subtropical high-pressure zone creating stable, descending air.

In your analysis, discuss the economic, political, and cultural consequences of primacy for a nation.",

Bangkok exemplifies primacy: 10+ million people vs. ~200,000 in second city Nonthaburi, containing most government, economic, and cultural institutions. Germany shows no primacy: Berlin (3.7M), Hamburg (1.9M), Munich (1.5M) form a polycentric system.

Strengths: Explains the Carolingian shift northward and decline of Mediterranean cities. Weaknesses: (1) Archaeological evidence shows Mediterranean trade continuing after Muslim conquests (e.g., Egyptian papyrus in Merovingian Gaul); (2) Economic decline began pre-Islam (e.g., Roman coinage degradation in 6th century).

        "answer": "The orographic effect is the cooling and precipitation that occurs when moist air is forced to rise over a mountain barrier. As the air ascends the windward side, it cools adiabatically, causing water vapor to condense and fall as rain or snow. By the time the air mass reaches the leeward side, it has lost most of its moisture. As it descends, it warms adiabatically, creating a drier, warmer rain shadow desert. This process makes the Sierra's west side lush and the east, in its rain shadow, arid."

For closure under addition: if trace(A)=0 and trace(B)=0, then trace(A+B) = (a11+b11)+(a22+b22) = (a11+a22)+(b11+b22) = 0+0=0.

The later British and French empires, while also mercantilist, emphasized different models: the British promoted agricultural settlement and local governance in North America, while the French focused on the fur trade, requiring less displacement of native peoples.

        "answer": "Continental deflection refers to the way major landmasses guide and constrain the flow of rivers and ocean currents over geological time. The Amazon Basin is defined by the uplift of the Andes to the west, which forces the river to flow eastward across the entire South American craton. Similarly, the Congo River's path is shaped by the basin-like geology of the African continent, flowing in a giant arc as it is deflected by surrounding highlands. These deflections create vast, unique drainage basins that are fundamental to the continent's ecology and hydrology."

Integrate both sides: e^(-x)y = ∫xe^(-x) dx. Using integration by parts, this equals -xe^(-x) - e^(-x) + C. Thus, y = -x - 1 + Ce^(x).

Both revolutions championed liberty and equality. A key philosophical difference lies in their conception of these ideals. The American Revolution focused on Lockean individual liberty and property rights, resulting in a constitutional republic.

        "answer": "A biome is a large-scale community of plants and animals characterized by distinct climate patterns and ecological adaptations. Latitude primarily determines temperature, creating bands from the cold poles (tundra) to the warm equator (tropical rainforest). Altitude mimics latitude; high mountains have tundra-like conditions regardless of location. Precipitation then differentiates biomes within temperature zones: high rain supports rainforests, moderate rain supports temperate forests, and low rain creates grasslands or deserts. The taiga (boreal forest) exists in high-latitude, cold regions with moderate precipitation, situated between the tundra and temperate biomes."

The coordinate vectors are: T(1) = [-1, 1]^T, T(x) = [1, 1]^T. So the matrix is A = [[-1, 1], [1, 1]]. The characteristic equation is det(A - λI) = (-1-λ)(1-λ) - (1)(1) = λ² - 2 = 0.

It provided a philosophical basis for authority. However, it was a double-edged sword. Natural disasters, famines, or military defeats could be interpreted as the dynasty losing the Mandate. This provided a ready-made justification for rebellion and regime change.

        "answer": "The Foehn effect is a rain shadow wind that occurs when moist air crosses a mountain range. As air rises on the windward side, it cools and loses moisture. Upon descending the leeward slopes, it warms adiabatically at a faster dry rate. This creates a strong, warm, dry wind. In the Alps, the Foehn can cause rapid snowmelt, increasing avalanche risk.

These matrices are related by [T]_B' = P^{-1} [T]_B P, where P is the change-of-basis matrix from B' to B. This means [T]_B and [T]_B' are similar matrices.

        "answer": "Plate tectonics theory describes the lithosphere divided into plates that move over the asthenosphere. At a convergent boundary where oceanic crust subducts under continental crust, the denser oceanic plate sinks into the mantle. This process creates a deep oceanic trench offshore. On the continental margin, it forces the crust upward, forming major mountain ranges like the Andes. The subducting plate melts, generating magma that rises to form violent stratovolcanoes. Intense friction also causes massive megathrust earthquakes. The entire Pacific Ring of Fire is defined by this type of boundary."

This simplifies to v = λ A^{-1}v. Since A is invertible, λ ≠ 0. Rearranging, we get A^{-1}v = (1/λ)v.

The long-term impact was profound. Diocletian and Constantine responded by fundamentally restructuring the state, creating the Dominate. This included the Tetrarchy to share power, a massive, separate military and civil administration, price controls, and tying peasants to the land.

Its management is inherently interdisciplinary because a watershed rarely aligns with political borders. Pollution, water extraction, or deforestation in one jurisdiction directly impacts downstream communities in another. This creates complex challenges requiring international or interstate cooperation (e.g., the Colorado River Compact). Effective management must balance human needs (agriculture, cities) with environmental health (aquifer recharge, biodiversity), making it a nexus of hydrology, policy, economics, and ecology."

Since 2^n is a solution to the homogeneous equation, we look for a particular solution of the form a_n^(p) = C*n*2^n. Substitute into the recurrence: C*n*2^n = 5C*(n-1)*2^(n-1) - 6C*(n-2)*2^(n-2) + 2^n. Divide by 2^(n-2): 4Cn = 10C(n-1) - 6C(n-2) + 4. Solving gives C = -2.

Urbanization replaces permeable soil with impermeable surfaces (concrete, asphalt), drastically reducing infiltration and increasing the volume and speed of stormwater runoff, causing flash floods. Both activities disrupt the natural balance, amplifying flood risk and reducing water availability during dry periods."

        "answer": "The Schlieffen Plan was Germany's strategy to avoid a two-front war by quickly defeating France via a sweep through neutral Belgium before turning to Russia. Its failure was due to Belgian/British resistance, logistical overstretch, and the French counter-attack at the Marne. This failure meant a quick victory was impossible. Both sides then 'raced to the sea', extending fortified trench lines from Switzerland to the English Channel. Without the mobility for flanking maneuvers, armies were locked in a brutal stalemate, leading to four years of attritional warfare defined by artillery and infantry assaults on fixed positions."

It is the source of the port's exports (e.g., agricultural goods, minerals) and the market for its imports (e.g., manufactured goods). The gateway city provides the specialized infrastructure (docks, warehouses, financial services) to connect the hinterland to global trade networks. The relationship is symbiotic: the hinterland's productivity determines the port's volume and wealth, while the port's efficiency and connectivity determine the hinterland's access to markets and economic viability. A port cannot thrive without a productive hinterland, and vice versa."

        "answer": "Soil salinization is the accumulation of water-soluble salts in the soil. In arid regions like the Indus Valley, high evaporation rates and poor drainage are the main culprits. When farmers irrigate, water percolates down, dissolving natural salts in the earth. In poorly drained soils, this water table rises. Capillary action then draws the saline water to the surface, where it evaporates, leaving the salts behind as a crust. Over time, this process can render fertile land toxic to most crops, drastically reducing agricultural productivity and threatening food security in some of the world's most important breadbaskets."

        "answer": "A fjord is a long, deep, narrow inlet of the sea with steep sides, formed by glacial erosion. During ice ages, massive glaciers flow through existing river valleys. The immense weight and abrasive power of the ice deepens, widens, and straightens the V-shaped river valley into a U-shaped glacial trough. As the glacier retreats, sea levels rise, flooding the deeply excavated trough with seawater. The characteristic shallow sill at the mouth of a fjord is often terminal moraine debris deposited by the glacier, which restricts water flow and helps maintain the fjord's deep, calm waters."

Landlords, desperate for laborers, were forced to commute labor obligations into cash rents and offer better terms. This broke the traditional bonds of serfdom and the self-sufficient manorial economy.

Immigration rates are higher on larger islands (bigger targets) and islands closer to the mainland. Extinction rates are lower on larger islands (more resources, larger populations). Therefore, large islands near the mainland will have the highest species diversity, while small, isolated islands will have the lowest.

It deflects objects to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This deflection is zero at the equator and strongest at the poles. For hurricanes, which are low-pressure systems, air rushes inward.

For diagonalizability, the geometric multiplicity (dimension of the eigenspace) must equal the algebraic multiplicity. However, (A - 2I) = [[0,1],[0,0]], which has rank 1, so its nullspace (the eigenspace) has dimension 1. The minimal polynomial is (λ-2)², not (λ-2), because (A-2I) ≠ 0.

In summer, intense heating of the Tibetan Plateau creates a massive low-pressure system, drawing in moisture-laden southwesterly winds from the Indian Ocean. This orographic uplift against the Himalayas causes torrential rainfall. In winter, the plateau cools, creating a high-pressure system that generates dry, northeasterly winds. The plateau acts as an elevated heat source, dramatically amplifying the thermal contrast between land and sea that drives the monsoon circulation.

The characteristic polynomial of B is det(B - λI) = det(P⁻¹AP - λI) = det(P⁻¹AP - P⁻¹(λI)P) = det(P⁻¹(A - λI)P). Using the multiplicative property of determinants, this equals det(P⁻¹) * det(A - λI) * det(P) = (1/det(P)) * det(A - λI) * det(P) = det(A - λI).

        "answer": "Subduction is the process where one tectonic plate converges and sinks beneath another into the mantle. When dense oceanic crust subducts beneath lighter continental crust, it creates a deep oceanic trench offshore. The continental plate is crumpled, forming a coastal mountain range (e.g., the Andes). Melting of the subducting slab generates magma that rises, creating a volcanic arc parallel to the trench. If two oceanic plates converge, the older, denser one subducts, forming a deep trench and a volcanic island arc (e.g., the Mariana Islands). Continental crust is too buoyant to subduct, so continent-continent collisions create massive, non-volcanic mountain ranges like the Himalayas."

As global temperatures rise, permafrost thaws, allowing microbes to decompose this previously frozen organic matter. This process releases greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere. These emissions further intensify global warming, which in turn leads to more permafrost thaw.

This stretching thins the crust, causing it to sink and form a rift, flanked by fault-block mountains and volcanoes.

We can use the double-angle identity: sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x). The equation becomes a*sin(x) + b*cos(x) + 2c*sin(x)cos(x) = 0. This must hold for all x. Choose specific values: Let x=0: a*0 + b*1 + 2c*0*1 = b = 0, so b=0. Let x=π/2: a*1 + 0 + 2c*1*0 = a = 0, so a=0. We are left with 2c*sin(x)cos(x)=0 for all x. Since sin(x)cos(x) is not identically zero, we must have c=0. Thus, the only solution is a=b=c=0, so the set is linearly independent."

        "answer": "Ocean acidification is the ongoing decrease in the pH of the Earth's oceans, caused by the uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere. CO₂ dissolves in seawater to form carbonic acid (H₂CO₃), which dissociates, releasing hydrogen ions (H⁺) and lowering pH. The increase in H⁺ ions reduces the concentration of carbonate ions (CO₃²⁻). Marine calcifiers like corals, mollusks, and plankton use carbonate ions to build their calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) shells and skeletons. With less carbonate available, calcification becomes more energetically costly, leading to weaker structures, reduced growth rates, and increased vulnerability to erosion and predation."

The North's free-labor ideology and the political power of the expanding Republican Party threatened the South's slave-based social order and its political control in Congress, making secession seem like the only way to preserve its way of life."

        "answer": "Cultural geography studies the spatial aspects of human culture. The 'cultural landscape', a key concept, is the visible human imprint on the Earth's surface. It results from the interaction between a cultural group and its natural environment. The environment provides materials and constraints (e.g., stone for building, climate for agriculture), while the culture imposes its values, beliefs, and technologies onto the landscape, transforming it (e.g., terraced farming, urban grids, religious structures). The landscape is thus a palimpsest, reflecting the ongoing, two-way relationship where nature influences culture and culture reshapes nature."

        "answer": "Consider the set of monomials {1, x, x², x³, ...}. This set is linearly independent because a finite linear combination a₀ + a₁x + ... + a_nx^n is the zero polynomial if and only if all coefficients a₀, a₁, ..., a_n are zero. This set is also a spanning set for P(R), as every polynomial is a finite linear combination of these monomials. Therefore, {1, x, x², ...} is a basis for P(R). Since this basis has infinitely many elements, the dimension of P(R) is infinite."

        "answer": "The Meiji Restoration was a direct response to the threat of Western imperialism, exemplified by Commodore Perry's arrival. It was 'defensive' because the goal was to strengthen Japan to avoid China's fate. Politically, it restored imperial rule (ending the shogunate) and created a centralized, constitutional government. Economically, it abolished feudalism, promoted industrialization, and built a modern infrastructure (railroads, telegraphs). Militarily, it conscripted a national army and navy based on Western models. This top-down, comprehensive transformation turned Japan from an isolated feudal society into a modern imperial power within a single generation."

        "answer": "The natural greenhouse effect is caused by greenhouse gases (e.g., water vapor, CO₂, methane) that trap a portion of the sun's heat in the atmosphere, maintaining Earth's average temperature at about 15°C instead of -18°C. This makes the planet habitable. The enhanced (anthropogenic) greenhouse effect is the additional warming caused by human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, which significantly increases the concentration of these gases (especially CO₂). This extra layer of insulation traps more heat, disrupting the planet's energy balance and causing global warming and associated climate changes."

It fixed currencies to the US dollar, which was convertible to gold, promoting stability and facilitating post-war reconstruction and trade. It shaped a period of unprecedented growth and economic integration under US leadership. It collapsed in the early 1970s due to inherent contradictions: the US could not maintain both the dollar's value and its role as global liquidity provider. Growing US inflation and balance-of-payments deficits led to a loss of confidence, forcing President Nixon to suspend dollar-gold convertibility, ending the system of fixed exchange rates."

        "answer": "The global conveyor belt is a system of deep-ocean currents driven by density differences (thermo = temperature, haline = salinity). Cold, salty water is dense and sinks in the North Atlantic, initiating a deep-water current. This water flows south, eventually upwelling in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, warming, and returning to the North Atlantic as a surface current to complete the loop. This circulation redistributes vast amounts of heat from the tropics to the poles, moderating global climate. For example, it gives Northern Europe a milder climate than comparable latitudes. Disruption of this system could cause significant regional climate shifts."

Its pattern is characterized by single-use zoning, separation of homes from shops and jobs, and car dependency. Environmentally, it leads to habitat loss, increased air and water pollution from vehicles, and higher per-capita energy consumption. Socio-economically, it can create 'food deserts', increase infrastructure costs for municipalities, and exacerbate social segregation by income.

The volume of the unit sphere is (4/3)π(1)³ = 4π/3. Therefore, the flux = 3 * (4π/3) = 4π.

The left-hand and right-hand limits both equal 0. Therefore, f is continuous at 0 (and everywhere else). Differentiability: To be differentiable at 0, the derivative from the left must equal the derivative from the right. f'(x) = 1 for x>0 and f'(x) = -1 for x<0. Thus, lim_(h→0⁺) [f(0+h)-f(0)]/h = 1, and lim_(h→0⁻) [f(0+h)-f(0)]/h = -1. Since these one-sided derivatives are not equal, f is not differentiable at x=0."

        "answer": "The Hadley Cell is a large-scale atmospheric convection cell in the tropics. Warm, moist air rises at the equator (the Intertropical Convergence Zone), creating low pressure and heavy rainfall. As the air moves poleward at high altitude, it cools and descends around 30° latitude north and south. This descending air is dry and creates a zone of high pressure. The compression of the descending air warms it, further reducing relative humidity and inhibiting cloud formation. This results in the arid conditions that characterize the world's subtropical deserts, including the Sahara, Arabian, and Australian deserts, which lie under these stable, high-pressure zones."
