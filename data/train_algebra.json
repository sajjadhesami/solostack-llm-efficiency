    "question": "Using the concept of determinants, explain why a system of three linear equations has no solution if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero, but the augmented matrix has a non-zero determinant in at least one of its submatrices.",
    "answer": "A zero determinant indicates the coefficient matrix is singular, meaning its columns are linearly dependent and it doesn't span the full vector space. The system Ax=b has a solution only if b is in the column space of A. If the augmented matrix [A|b] has a higher rank than A (a larger non-zero submatrix determinant), it means b is not in the column space of A, creating an inconsistency. Geometrically, this represents three planes that do not intersect at a common point."

    "answer": "To be a subspace, the set must contain the zero vector and be closed under addition and scalar multiplication. The zero matrix has a trace of zero, so it is included. For closure under addition: if trace(A)=0 and trace(B)=0, then trace(A+B) = (a11+b11)+(a22+b22) = (a11+a22)+(b11+b22) = 0+0=0. For scalar multiplication: trace(cA) = c*a11 + c*a22 = c*(a11+a22) = c*0 = 0. All three conditions are satisfied, thus it is a subspace."

Integrate both sides: e^(-x)y = ∫xe^(-x) dx. Using integration by parts, this equals -xe^(-x) - e^(-x) + C. Thus, y = -x - 1 + Ce^(x). This represents a family of curves where each is an exponential function e^x scaled by C, shifted down by the line y = -x - 1."

The coordinate vectors are: T(1) = [-1, 1]^T, T(x) = [1, 1]^T. So the matrix is A = [[-1, 1], [1, 1]]. The characteristic equation is det(A - λI) = (-1-λ)(1-λ) - (1)(1) = λ² - 2 = 0.

These matrices are related by [T]_B' = P^{-1} [T]_B P, where P is the change-of-basis matrix from B' to B. This means [T]_B and [T]_B' are similar matrices.

This simplifies to v = λ A^{-1}v. Since A is invertible, λ ≠ 0. Rearranging, we get A^{-1}v = (1/λ)v.

Since 2^n is a solution to the homogeneous equation, we look for a particular solution of the form a_n^(p) = C*n*2^n. Substitute into the recurrence: C*n*2^n = 5C*(n-1)*2^(n-1) - 6C*(n-2)*2^(n-2) + 2^n. Divide by 2^(n-2): 4Cn = 10C(n-1) - 6C(n-2) + 4. Solving gives C = -2.

    "question": "Explain the phenomenon of 'eutrophication' in aquatic ecosystems, detailing the sequence of events from nutrient input to the formation of 'dead zones'.",
    "answer": "Eutrophication is the process where a water body becomes overly enriched with nutrients, primarily nitrogen and phosphorus from agricultural runoff and sewage. This stimulates excessive growth of algae and phytoplankton (an algal bloom). When these organisms die, they sink and are decomposed by bacteria. This bacterial decomposition consumes dissolved oxygen in the water. The resulting severe oxygen depletion (hypoxia) creates 'dead zones' where most aquatic life, including fish and invertebrates, cannot survive due to suffocation. This disrupts the entire ecosystem, causing biodiversity loss and fish kills."

    "question": "Find the general solution to the partial differential equation: ∂²u/∂x∂y = 0.",
    "answer": "Let w = ∂u/∂y. Then the equation becomes ∂w/∂x = 0. This implies that w is a function of y only: w(y) = ∂u/∂y. Now integrate with respect to y: u(x,y) = ∫ w(y) dy + f(x), where f(x) is an arbitrary function of x. Since ∫ w(y) dy is an antiderivative of w(y), it is itself a function of y only, which we can call g(y). Therefore, the general solution is u(x,y) = f(x) + g(y), where f and g are arbitrary twice-differentiable functions."

    "answer": "Let U and W be subspaces of V. Let Z = U ∩ W. 1) Since U and W are subspaces, both contain the zero vector. Therefore, 0 is in Z. 2) Closure under addition: Let x and y be any vectors in Z. Then x and y are in U, and since U is a subspace, x+y is in U. Similarly, x and y are in W, so x+y is in W. Therefore, x+y is in U ∩ W = Z. 3) Closure under scalar multiplication: Let x be in Z and c be a scalar. Then x is in U, so cx is in U. x is in W, so cx is in W. Therefore, cx is in U ∩ W = Z. Thus, Z is a subspace of V."

    "question": "Show that the set of all skew-symmetric n x n matrices (i.e., matrices A such that A^T = -A) forms a subspace of M_n(R). What is its dimension?",
    "answer": "Let S be the set of skew-symmetric matrices. 1) The zero matrix is skew-symmetric, so 0 ∈ S. 2) If A, B ∈ S, then (A+B)^T = A^T+B^T = -A + (-B) = -(A+B), so A+B ∈ S. 3) If A ∈ S and c is a scalar, then (cA)^T = c A^T = c(-A) = -cA, so cA ∈ S. Thus, S is a subspace. For dimension: A skew-symmetric implies diagonal entries are 0. The entries below the diagonal determine those above (a_ij = -a_ji). The number of free entries is the number of entries in the lower triangle: n(n-1)/2. Therefore, dim(S) = n(n-1)/2."
